# Data-Mining
This project includes varios Data Mining tasks to complete. I used diabates information for any given task below. Choosing dataset which appropriate for all tasks below is important for clear understanding and using algorithms together.

## Completed tasks in this project

- Explaination of the dataset we used / Data exploration, data investigation
- Data cleaning and data imputation
- Outlier removal --> ( _I used Z-score_ )
- Using PCA to reduce dimension and visualizing it as 3D scatter plot
- Supervised learning, use a proper model selection approach (i.e. Decision Tree, Naive Bayes) on this data ( _I used most of the Supervised Learning algorithms, then I compared the results_ )
- unsupervised learning (i.e. k-means) on this data ( _I used K-means for Unsupervised Learning. Also, I used elbow method for determining cluster number_ )
- Use one of below on this data - or you choose a similar method 
  - Association Rule Mining --> ( _I used this this method for this project, you can try different methods also_ )
  - Text Mining 
  - Predictive Analytics etc.
